                Whom do we perceive as more powerful and prefer to give power to: Those who have self-control or those who lack it? Past theory and research provide divergent predictions. Low self-control can be seen as a form of disinhibition, and disinhibition has been associated with greater power. However, high self-control can be seen as a form of agency, which is associated with greater power. Across seven studies, we found that individuals who exhibited high self-control were seen as more powerful, and given more power, than individuals who exhibited low self-control. We also demonstrated an important implication of our findings for goal setting: People were perceived as more powerful and given more power when they had a modest goal but exceeded it than when they had an ambitious goal but failed to meet it, even though in both cases they performed the same action. A meta-analysis of our mediation results showed that people perceived individuals higher in self-control as more assertive and competent, which was associated with greater power perception and then with greater power conferral. Perceived competence also directly mediated the effect of self-control on power conferral. The current research addresses a theoretical debate in the power literature and contributes to a better understanding of how power is perceived and accrued.

                •	Obtained a research grant exceeding $15,000 to investigate lay theories concerning the causal impact of power on morality and their organizational implications. <br>
                •	Applied qualitative coding techniques to analyze lay theories related to the  effect of power on morality, revealing two prominent themes: "Power Corrupts" and "Power Reveals". <br>
                •	Developed and validated a two-factor scale to measure the lay theories, conducting rigorous tests for  factor structure, measurement invarance, test-retest reliability, and discriminant validity.  <br>
                •	Demonstrated the incremental validity of the lay theories in predicting motivation to attain power at work using hierarchical linear regressions and structural equation modeling.  <br>
                •	Conducted a time-lagged field survey to examine the differential impact of the two lay theories on trust towards top management and supervisors.  <br>
                •	Recruited representative samples to investigate the varying effects of the two lay theories on support for organizational policies aimed at mitigating power abuse. <br>
                •	Organized and chaired a symposium on "Power, Status, and Leadership" at the Academy of Management (AOM) conference to present research findings.<br>
                •	Drafted a research paper as the first author for submission to <i>Journal of Applied Psychology</i>, highlighting the impact of lay theories in the workplace.

                •	Developed, preregistered, and implemented a Zoom-based dyadic experiment involving over 600 participants and analyzed conversation content to reveal a significant finding: individuals in positions of power exhibit reduced self-disclosure depth.<br>
                •	Employed a combination of vigenette-based experiments and field surveys to uncover why high-power individuals self-disclose less deeply: they perceive less value in social connection.<br>
